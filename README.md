In December of 2020, I'll be graduating as a mechanical engineer at Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA). This repo will be used to store all my senior thesis work related to coding.

My goal is to research on air coinditioning models that are more efficient and require a smaller cost of production. Doing so, I hope to contribute on further productions of more accessable Air Conditioning, so they can reach places they are more needed, such as public schools in Brazil.
